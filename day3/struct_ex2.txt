Write a function which queries the list of channels from the Slack API.
Parse this data to find and return the channel ID of the "random" channel.

Write a second function which posts a message to the "random channel". You
can view the Slack documentation for this endpoint here:

https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage

Parse the data returned from the API to gather the timestamp and user who
wrote the message. Return this data from the function and pretty print it
in the main of your program.
