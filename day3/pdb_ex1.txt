Pdb Ex1
------------

Copy the func_ex1.py into pdb_ex1.py. In this program add the following to the middle of your
program:

import pdb
pdb.set_trace()


Execute your program and verify that you drop into the debugger.

a. List 10 or more lines around your current point.

b. Execute next three times.

c. Print out a variable in your program

d. Execute !my_var = 72 and verify this variable is now set in your program using 'p my_var'.

e. Set a breakpoint ahead of your current point. Use 'continue' to execute and verify you are now
stopped at the breakpoint.

f. Use 'step' to descend down into a function call. Once in the function use 'up' to go up the
stack once and 'down' to descend back down the stack once.

g. Use 'args' to see the arguments that were passed into the function.

h. Use 'q' to exit the debugger.
